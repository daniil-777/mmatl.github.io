My name is Matthew Matl, and I'm a second year PhD student in EECS at UC Berkeley.
I am advised by Professor [Ken Godlberg](http://goldberg.berkeley.edu/) of the [UC Berkeley Autolab](http://autolab.berkeley.edu/), and
my research primarily focuses on robotic manipulation.
Specifically, I am interested in developing algorithms that allow robots to peform complex manipulation tasks in unstructured environments, with an eye towards applications such as industrial bin-picking, logistics, and flexible manufacturing and assembly.

I attended Princeton University for my undergraduate education, where I received a BSE in Electrical Engineering.
