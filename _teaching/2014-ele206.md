I worked as a teaching assistant for two years on ELE 206: Contemporary Logic Design.
During the first year, I served as a lab TA, helping students to write and debug Verilog for FPGA-based programming projects.
During my second year, I re-wrote the labs for the class, including much more detailed lab manuals, test benches, and a sixty-page tutorial on the Verilog language.
