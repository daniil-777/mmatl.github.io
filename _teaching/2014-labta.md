I worked as a laboratory teaching assistant for two years for the following courses:

*   COS 126: Introduction to Computer Science
*   COS 226: Algorithms and Data Structures
*   COS 217: Introduction to Programming Systems

I helped students to understand fundamental programming concepts and debug their code for their weekly assigments and final projects.
